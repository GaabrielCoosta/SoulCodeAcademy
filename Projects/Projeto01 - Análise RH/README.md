## Project - Analyzing an HR database

**PROJECT DEVELOPERS**
  - Aska Pereira
  - Maria Eduarda Klug
  - Gabriel Andrade

#### :heavy_minus_sign: CONTEXT

- *The company XPTO is concerned about the retention of talent in the company and is conducting a descriptive analysis of a series of employee attributes with the main objective of discovering possible relationships (and even correlations) that explain the level of employee attrition with the company. The variable wear with **value=yes** represents employees who resigned and left the company because they felt worn out with XPTO, while this same variable with **value=no**, represents employees who remain with the company*

#### :heavy_minus_sign: PROJECT OBJECTIVE:

- *Explore (**through project management techniques and exploratory data analysis learned so far in the bootcamp**) some of the possible relationships and insights that can be obtained from the database. Use the group's synthesis power to find and present only the insights that in the group's view can really help the company achieve its goals with this analysis 
(**remembering that the main objective is to have an environment where employees do not feel worn out with XPTO**)*

#### :heavy_minus_sign: MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
     
- *Measures of descriptive statistics (**central tendency, dispersion, separators and association**) of at least 4 attributes that can help with insights relevant to the company*
    
- *At least three frequency distributions for different attributes, being mandatory quantitative and qualitative attributes, remembering that for quantitative attributes the frequency distributions must be grouped by value ranges*

- *Appropriate graphics for each attribute chosen by the group, with the possibility of having one more different graphic per chosen attribute*

- *Report in slides (google presentations, Powerpoint or canva) should be attached only one report per group*

#### :heavy_minus_sign: OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
  
- *Correlations, scatter plots and box plots **(box plot)** for the attributes chosen by the group*
 
- *Analysis **S.W.O.T** to solve the problem*

- *Specification of a design methodology **(CRISP DM, KDD or SEMMA)** for the context of the problem*


**The choice of attributes that will be part of the group analysis must be made and discussed by the group. All elements of the group must actively participate in the work, but the group is allowed to choose whether only one member will present or if all will present. Remember that even if you don't present the group member, you can and will probably be questioned by the teachers immediately after the group's presentation**
