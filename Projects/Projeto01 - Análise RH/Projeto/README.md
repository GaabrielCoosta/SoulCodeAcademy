### DATA COLLECT

- Analysis made from **internal and secondary data**

### DATA PROCESSING

- Organization of the "base_rh" worksheet, provided by the company XPTO, putting the attributes in order by consistency and relationship, separating the personal data of each employee from the data related to the company

### DATA EXPLORATION

- At this stage, we performed an exploratory analysis of the data, using only Google Sheets and Excel tools.
First, we performed correlation calculations for all attributes with the “wear and tear” attribute to have a better visualization,
and we can define the attributes as relevant or not for our analysis.

### FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS AND GRAPHICS

  - *ALL CALCULATIONS WERE PERFORMED IN PYTHON USING THE GOOGLE COLAB TOOL*
  ```bash
# DOWNLOAD THE DATABASE FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING
'base_rh.csv'
'Dicionário_base.csv''

# OPEN THE PROJECT .ipynb
