## Project - Python Fundamentals
This project has as main objective to provide the student with the verification of the main technical skills on Python fundamentals learned in the fourth week of the Data Analysis Bootcamp in the AD2 class. The proposal combines fundamental concepts of Python with the theme of the first week of Bootcamp (exploratory data analysis);

In this project, the student must individually build a script in Python that receives from the user two variables of values ​​referring to quantitative variables and returns the following measures of descriptive statistics for each informed variable as a response:
- Arithmetic average;
- Median;
- Fashion (if any);
- Sampling variance
- Sample Standard Deviation
- Total amplitude;
- Q1 (first quartile);
- Q3 (third quartile);
- AIQ (interquartile range);
- Lower Limit (Li from the boxplot)
- Upper Limit (Ls of the boxplot)
- Identifier and classification of possible outliers in the sample;
- Pearson(r) correlation coefficient;
- Coefficient of determination (r squared)
- Coefficient a or alpha of the simple linear regression equation for the two variables chosen by the user;
- Coefficient b or beta of the simple linear regression equation for the two variables chosen by the user;
  
### Mandatory Requirements:
- The program must contain all the descriptive statistics measures requested in the previous block;
 
### The program must contain at least the following structures:
- 1 - (if, elif and else);
- 1 - (repeating For loop);
- 1 - (while loop);

**The program cannot incorporate modules and frameworks not studied so far in the bootcamp;**

### Non-mandatory requirements (optional):
- Error handling for user inputs;
- Any other code improvements that are not contrary to mandatory requirements;
