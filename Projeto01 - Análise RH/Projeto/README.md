### UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
**Information obtained:**
- *"The XPTO company is concerned with retaining talent in the company [...] The employees resigned and left the company because they felt worn out with the XPTO"*

#### üíé 5W-s Technique

**üìå Why is this analysis important for the business?**

- So that we can understand what is causing employee burnout and consequently reduce resignations

**üìå Who will we review?**

- We will analyze the employees of the company XPTO

**üìå What will we review?**

- The possible reason for burnout of employees, who resigned

**üìå What period will be considered for the analyzes?**

- The period of employment of the employee with the XPTO company will be considered

**üìå Where?**

- Specifically within the XPTO company through the data provided by the company's HR

### DATA COLLECT

- Analysis made from **internal and secondary data**

### DATA PROCESSING

- Organization of the "base_rh" worksheet, provided by the company XPTO, putting the attributes in order by consistency and relationship, separating the personal data of each employee from the data related to the company

### DATA EXPLORATION

- At this stage, we performed an exploratory analysis of the data, using only Google Sheets and Excel tools.
First, we performed correlation calculations for all attributes with the ‚Äúwear and tear‚Äù attribute to have a better visualization,
and we can define the attributes as relevant or not for our analysis.

#### FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS AND GRAPHICS

  - *ALL CALCULATIONS WERE PERFORMED IN PYTHON USING THE GOOGLE COLAB TOOL*
  ```bash
# DOWNLOAD THE DATABASE FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING
'base_rh(1).csv'

# OPEN THE PROJECT .ipynb
'Projeto_01.ipynb'
```

### CONCLUS√ÉO
