 ## Activity 

*First activity about was having problems through logical reasoning, using the python language!*


## Running Script
- Python 3+ and Google Colaboratory

[Python_Activities_AD2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1d9HYPFO2nQ4GBHsJTZ3j-NQn01Kfyx1x?usp=sharing)
```bash
# Access the script through the file:
 "Python_Activities_AD2.ipynb" or via the hyperlink above


# Carefully read the project instructions
- Design with own functions
- Project with libraries that are not natively sourced from the Google Colab tool

#Attention
- For the question resolutions to work correctly, it is necessary to
execute all cells!
```


## Requirements

- *Use Python 3+ (and COFFEE ☕️) to solve the problem*
- *Use *git* and *github* to version your code. Try to send (commits) all stages of evolution of your implementation.*
- *Create a readme.md to explain how to use your project.*


### Support Documentation

- [Use the official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
